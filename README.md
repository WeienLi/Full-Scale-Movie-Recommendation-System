# Team-3

Code for our project. Please try to update this document as we add more features/changes.

## Installation (Skip this part if running with docker)

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Keep requirements.txt up to date if you install some new packages:

```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## Running kafka-consumer

ðŸŸ¥ IMPORTANT: You'll need to be on the McGill network (Wifi or VPN) to access the Kafka streams.

#### Read user ratings

```
python kafka-consumer/read_ratings.py
```

## Running flask_API

The recommender API can be run inside a Docker container. A utility script (`docker.sh`) can help you easily manage the server.

#### Prerequisites

Docker must be installed on the machine ([Download Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)).
(Linux/MacOS) Make the utility script executable:

```
chmod +x docker.sh
```

#### Starting the server

Starts the Flask API server in the background inside a Docker container.

```
./docker.sh start
```

#### Accessing the API

See the API in action by going to `http://<ip-of-the-virtual-machine>:8082`:

- **http://127.0.0.1:8082/** - If you're running this locally. Otherwise, you may need to port forward if you're running the API on a remote machine.
- **http://fall2022-comp585-3.cs.mcgill.ca:8082/** - If you're running the API on our team's remote server. NOTE: You'll need to be on McGill VPN to access this.

#### Stopping the server

Stops all running Docker instances of the Flask API server.

```
./docker.sh stop
```
