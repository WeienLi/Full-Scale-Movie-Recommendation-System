# Team-3

Code for our project. Please try to update this document as we add more features/changes.

## Installation (Skip this part if running with docker)

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Keep requirements.txt up to date if you install some new packages:

```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## Running kafka-consumer

ðŸŸ¥ IMPORTANT: You'll need to be on the McGill network (Wifi or VPN) to access the Kafka streams.

#### Read user ratings

```
python kafka-consumer/read_ratings.py
```

## Running flask_API

The recommender API can be run inside a Docker container. A utility script (`docker.sh`) can help you easily manage the server.

#### Prerequisites

Docker must be installed on the machine ([Download Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)).
(Linux/MacOS) Make the utility script executable:

```
chmod +x docker.sh
```

#### Starting the server

Starts the Flask API server in the background inside a Docker container.

```
./docker.sh start
```

#### Accessing the API

See the API in action by going to `http://<ip-of-the-virtual-machine>:8082`:

- **http://127.0.0.1:8082/** - If you're running this locally. Otherwise, you may need to port forward if you're running the API on a remote machine.
- **http://fall2022-comp585-3.cs.mcgill.ca:8082/** - If you're running the API on our team's remote server. NOTE: You'll need to be on McGill VPN to access this.

#### Stopping the server

Stops all running Docker instances of the Flask API server.

```
./docker.sh stop
```

#### Resetting Docker

Removes all Docker data associated with the project from the host.

```
./docker.sh reset
```

## Monitoring

Prometheus+Grafana is configured to run by default alongside the API. Prometheus collects and stores various metrics from the API, and Grafana visualizes these metrics in dashboards for monitoring. Additionally, AlertManager is integrated with Prometheus to send our alerts for critical issues via Slack.

NOTE: These services are only available when the project is running inside Docker.

### Grafana

See the Grafana dashboards at `http://<ip-of-the-virtual-machine>:3000/dashboards`

- **http://127.0.0.1:3000/dashboards** - If you're running this locally.
- **http://fall2022-comp585-3.cs.mcgill.ca:3000/dashboards** - If you're running the project on our team's remote server.
